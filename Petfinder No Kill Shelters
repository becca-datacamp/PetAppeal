By being in a safe outdoor environment, the numbers of airborne illnesses are reduced keeping cats healthier while in a shelter environment.

They are alone, they are fearful, and most of them are euthanized. As their lives silently end, several thousand more pets are being born who will endure the same fate.

To date, she has helped rescue and place over 20,000 cats and dogs that would have otherwise been destroyed in shelters.

63,Petaluma,"We are a group of dedicated volunteers committed to the rescue of dogs from crisis situations. Some of these situations include euthanasia by animal shelters, neglect and other forms of abuse, potential use in research laboratory testing, or use as bait for the training of fighting dogs.  Our rescued animals are immediately placed in foster homes, not kennels. Foster homes are the most crucial yet challenging ingredient to our rescue efforts. Without available foster homes, many dogs are unable to be rescued. However with foster homes, each dog is provided a nurturing home environment that includes food, shelter, exercise, and, most importantly, love. These animals come to understand that the safest place in the world is in the arms of their caretakers. Once the dog is ready, she or he is adopted into a thoroughly screened, caring, and permanent home.  You may ask, ""What is so unique about NBCR&amp;P, and why would one choose to adopt from, volunteer with, or contribute to NBCR&amp;P?"" The bottom line with most rescue groups is the welfare of our canine companions, so in that respect we are no different than anyone else. However, unlike many other organizations, we do take special care with very sick or injured animals. We have, on occasion, taken dogs from shelters that have broken bones, epilepsy, internal malformations, drastic skin problems, pneumonia, and other ailments--some life threatening. We spare no expense with vet care in doing what is required to help these animals as long as we are reasonably sure that the dog, once brought back to health, can lead a quality, pain-free life.

Examples of some of the ways we take in/rescue animals:  Owner gives up pet  Pet is abandoned  Pet is rescued from abuse  Dogs/Cats/Puppies/Kittens found on the streets and we are unable to locate the owner  Volunteers at a shelter request help in placing a pet that needs a chance  We have a very aggressive adoption program. We carefully screen each prospective ""Pet Parent"" and spaying and Neutering is a requirement of each adoption. We vaccinate all of our animals and take care of any known medical requirements.  When a pet is adopted, a space in one of our foster homes or our kennel is opened up so that we can take in another pet. When we rescue a pet, they stay in our kennel or foster homes until they are adopted.  We also have a trap spay/neuter program. We trap feral and abandoned cats, spay/neuter them and release them back to the area (upon request of the resident, and as time/money allows). We did a trap, spay/neuter project at the Chevron Refinery in El Segundo, California and to date, we have altered/returned over one hundred cats that we now feed on a regular basis.  Obviously, we cannot rescue every pet in need, although we would like to! But each one of you can help.

86,Agoura Hills,"Southern California Siamese Rescue was born early in 2005, when we decided to divide California Siamese Rescue (CASR) into 2 separate, but closely aligned groups. CASR was extremely successful, but California is a very large state but after much thought, we felt we could provide more and better service to the cats and kittens we rescue if we became two groups.   We've always been amazed at the number of homeless Siamese in the shelters and on the streets. Due to the nature of the Siamese cat, they don't do well in shelters and due to civilization; they don't do well on the streets. That's where we come in. We work extensively with shelters and individuals to save these cats before they are euthanized in the shelters or killed on the streets. We feel that it is not the cat's fault that they become homeless and in order to make sure they don't end up that way again, we provide thorough screening of potential adopters before sending any of our cats to their 'forever' homes.

184,Peoria,"Foster Pet Outreach began in 1990 when three coworkers banded together to help a stray cat. Recognizing the need to better the lives of abandoned and abused animals in their community, they volunteered as a small group at the Peoria Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). Charter members helped clean cages, groom animals, walk dogs, and fostered selected animals in their homes. In 1991 a growing membership incorporated as an independent organization known as A Cause for Paws (ACFP). While ACFP was beginning to be recognized in the community, there was also confusion with PAWS because of the name similarity. Although the name was changed to Foster Pet Outreach in 1995, the commitment to placing animals in permanent homes remains the same. Over fifty animals are placed into loving homes each year by our organization. 2007 marks our seventeenth year dedicated to helping animals in need. Founded with a vision of an organization that would make a difference in the lives of unwanted animals in the Peoria area, today our membership is over 100 strong.   Address: P.O.

211,Downers Grove,"1901 W. Ogden Avenue Downers Grove, IL 60515  The West Suburban Humane Society (WSHS) is a volunteer-based, animal welfare organization that was founded in 1972 as a lost and found referral service.  At that time, a small group of volunteers working from their homes gathered information and maintained records for the purpose of reuniting lost companion animals and their owners.  Soon animal control officials in various townships and counties requested our help in locating the owners of unclaimed strays that were being held at their facilities. Over the next 10 years, as both demand and support for our services grew, WSHS began sheltering homeless animals by opening a small storefront shelter on Chicago's west side along with 3 additional small satellite shelters in other townships. Today, we have consolidated into one easily accessible and highly visible shelter and adoption facility, housing up to 25 dogs and 60 cats at a time. We operate at full capacity at all times, with animal care and adoptions being provided by 1 full-time and 6 part-time employees, and numerous volunteers. We are open to the public 6 days a week.  The cats and dogs come to us from many sources. Impoundment facilities and the public bring us dogs and cats from all ages who have been abandoned, abused, injured, neglected, and orphaned. A dedicated volunteer base and the retained services of several veterinarians has allowed us to save the lives of and place over 1,200 homeless animals each year into new homes. Every animal that is brought to our shelter receives whatever type of veterinary care that is needed, including surgery and hospitalization for trauma cases, long-term care and medication for viral and bacterial infections, and treatment of parasite infestations such as heartworm. Orphaned kittens and puppies as well as the infirmed receive loving care in our Temporary Care Homes until they are ready for adoption.",West Suburban Humane Society,Illinois,http://www.wshs-dg.org/,IL,1901 W.

214,Pierceton,"Working with an overflowing population of animals in a structure that needs constant attention, maintenance, and increased staff time, it is amazing what this staff has been able to accomplish in the last eight years. They struggle continuously to maintain a clean, healthy, almost odor free, facility in incredibly difficult situations.  Just think what this group of hard-working staff and wonderful volunteers could accomplish if they could move into the much more efficient, new, and well-designed structure! Following are where we (amazingly) are today: But read it and realize where we could (even more amazingly) be tomorrow with your help!  Since 2007 we have INCREASED adoptions by 22%...that is phenomenal in this economy, and when compared to other shelters in the state and nationally, we are above average in that rate.  Our return rate is almost miniscule when compared to those other shelters too. That means more people are getting healthier and better matched pets and are not returning them to us. This has long been one of our goals and it is working!  You will be impressed when you learn that since 2007 we have DECREASED our euthanization rate almost 35%. This is possible because of our herculean efforts to find good homes for our pets, our efforts to CURE more of what sometimes ails them, and our refusal to put animals down because we have no space. It also means we are running a cleaner and healthier shelter. This also sometimes takes tremendous effort and help from our community, but everyone stepping up to the plate has made this incredible improvement. Thank you!

When a shelter receives a pet, the cat or dog will be tested and evaluated to determine if the animal is adoptable or not. The three things that are considered when making this decision are the age, temperament, and health of the animal. If the animal is deemed adoptable, it is given an estimated duration at the shelter. The pets that are deemed un-adoptable are rejected and slated to be euthanized. This is where we step in.

What caused this, we will never know, but this is how Joa the paraplegic kitten came into one animal rescuer’s life and heart.   Though she had no use of her legs and little control of her bladder, Joa was a ball of fire – zipping around, playing hard and generally causing lovable havoc wherever she went. She is the perfect example of the fact that these special animals have no idea they are “handicap” and they are no less deserving of a loving home of their own. Sadly, not long after being adopted into a wonderful home, Joa passed away.  Joa's Arc wishes to help provide the opportunity, to pets like Joa, to know the love she had and provided. Some facts:  - Shelters have a very large number of animals coming into their facilities every day. - A lot of those animals also happen to have “special needs” ranging from broken bones to birth defects. - With so many healthy animals to worry about and very few resources, shelters cannot consider spending money on these special needs animals   Mailing Address: PO Box 243 Audubon, NJ 08106",Joa's Arc,New-Jersey,http://joasarc.blogspot.com/,NJ,PO Box 243,,Audubon,US,JoasArc@gmail.com,,39.8917,-75.0731,Joa's Arc,,NJ624,NJ,08106

When we have an open space, and with the aid of partnering animal control facilities we rescue friendly, adoptable death-row dogs and cats who have run out of time in shelters. Our mission is to stop the killing of thousands of friendly, adoptable dogs and cats abandoned at AC facilities. These pets die usually because guardians do not keep the lifetime commitment made initially to their pets. Because of the enormous number of pets being abandoned, New Mexico's under-staffed and under-funded animal control facilities don’t have enough space or funding to keep them alive until committed homes are found. The vast majority of abandoned pets in New Mexico and in the United States as a whole never make it out of the shelters alive.   We are a private 501c3 life-saving organization, and we have put our personal funds into this property and improvements, located at a deliberately highly visible &amp; accessible property on a major NM highway. We have ‘stepped out in faith’ that the community of animal-lovers will help us fund and support our mission for the betterment of the lives of the animals that we love.

We fight for the ones that have been forgotten, abandoned, discarded, and abused. We fight for the ones not many people care to look at. We fight for the ones that many people want to kill without a second thought. Quite often underneath a rough and tough exterior beats the heart of a truly gentle and loving soul. If people would only stop feeding into media hype and take the time to actually LEARN the truth, they would know. With knowledge comes awareness.  We continue to fight for them through perseverance, education, and tireless dedication. We will continue to fight for them until the day we die.

The first facility is the SPCA Curtis Dail Pet Adoption Center, located at 200 Petfinder Lane in Raleigh, which focuses on pet adoption and public education.

SPCA of Wake County No-Kill Statement:  By “No-Kill,” we mean that once we admit an animal into our care, we treat that animal no differently than we would expect a loving pet owner to do. We do not take the life of any animal in our care for reasons of length of stay or our shelter capacity. If our veterinarian determines that a pet in our care requires veterinary care, we provide that care so as to return that pet to a healthy or a manageable state. We euthanize a pet only if our veterinarian determines that the pet is too sick or injured to recover to a life of quality and is suffering or if our animal behavior specialist determines that a pet is so behaviorally aggressive as to present a material danger to human safety.

402,Madison Heights,"The Animal Welfare Society of Southeastern Michigan (""AWS"") was formed in 1982 by a group of concerned veterinarians and individuals who were alarmed at the rate of euthanasia performed on healthy and social cats, dogs, kittens and puppies. The goal of the organization is to secure homes for as many rescued animals as possible. In the past 26 years, AWS has found homes for over 18,000 ""unwanted"" felines and canines. These puppies, kittens, dogs and cats are rescued from various pounds throughout Michigan and Ohio, some are strays, and some are owner surrenders. Each accepted animal is given a thorough physical examination, vaccinations and treatment by a participating veterinarian to insure they are healthy and well adjusted. All animals over 4 months of age are spayed or neutered. An incentive sterilization deposit is refunded after the procedure is performed on animals under the age of 4 months.   AWS also strives to educate the public on the importance of spaying and neutering and responsible pet ownership. AWS adopts out approximately 800 cats and dogs per year.

Animals are examined by trained medical staff and area veterinarians who visit the shelter weekly on a rotating basis.  * Adoptions. We are a NO-KILL facility that strives to find a home for every adoptable animal.  * Humane Education. Through classroom visits, youth group programs, and civic group presentations, we bring the message of compassion, kindness and safety to hundreds of children and adults yearly.  * Lost and Found Services. Stray animals are brought to the shelter almost daily. We make efforts to reunite them with their owners by maintaining a lost/found directory and tracking callers who have either lost or found an animal. If the animal’s owner is not located after 7 business days, we try to find the animal a loving home.  * Anti-Cruelty Services. Cruelty and neglect of animals are both inhumane and illegal. Through education programs and referrals, we strive to educate the public about the laws governing animal care and cruelty. We work hand in hand with many area law enforcement agencies and other animal welfare organizations to ensure investigations of all cruelty and neglect reports and enforcement of all laws.  * Spay and Neuter Initiatives. Aggressive spay and neuter programs are essential to reducing the homeless animal population in our community. We work with other organizations to refer qualified persons to low-cost spay/neuter programs.  * Hope for the Helpless.

It was filled beyond capacity almost immediately. From the start, Dogwood offered low cost spays and neuters, and since 1997, when the board of directors declared Dogwood a no-kill facility, it has steadily expanded that program. When the long awaited new shelter facility, located near Osage Beach was built in 2005, a spay/neuter clinic was included so that the surgeries could be done on site.

471,East Smithfield,"Animal Care Sanctuary was founded as a non-profit organization by Lesley Sinclair in 1967 in Tom’s River, NJ. After outgrowing her operation in a converted chicken farm there, Sinclair moved to rural East Smithfield, PA in 1982. Ms. Sinclair passed away in 1998, leaving a legacy to care for the animals at the organization which she founded. 2012 marks our 45th anniversary as a non-profit no kill animal sanctuary and we are eager to continue the work that we do with and for homeless animals everywhere but most importantly, the animals who have found ACS as their temporary or forever home. As the nation’s fourth largest no-kill sanctuary, ACS welcomes animals that are in particular need, those that others deem “unadoptable” because of illness, injury, age, or because they just have not been able to find a home. At this time, we have more than 700 residents at our East Smithfield and Wellsboro locations including dogs, cats, horses, pigs, and birds. We work with these animals to find them permanent homes, but we offer lifetime care if this is not possible. We also offer animal care workshops, dog training courses including a masters course, grooming, and a low cost spay/neuter clinic available to the public five days a week. In the fall of 2009, ACS partnered with Maddie’s Fund Shelter Medicine Program at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine. The college’s Veterinary staff tours ACS facilities on an annual basis and offers recommendations for improving the animals’ medical and behavioral programs. ACS also transports sick and/or injured animals to Cornell for specialized treatments and surgeries by their shelter medicine team. In 2011, the Pennsylvania SPCA elected to discontinue their shelter services in Wellsboro, PA. In September of that year, ACS stepped in and took over the day to day operations which have proven very successful thus far. Having two locations in the state of Pennsylvania has helped us save hundreds more lives in the past seven months, as we continue to spay/neuter, vaccinate, educate, adopt, and provide a loving atmosphere for the animals who call ACS home.

Sitting on 129 scenic acres, ACS is a truly perfect setting for an animal sanctuary and shelter. Our Canine Care facility is well-maintained and fully staffed with caring and dedicated individuals who are committed to ensuring that the ACS residents are well cared for regardless of the length of their stay. The Canine Care building is 400 feet in length, which is less than optimal for the residents and the caregivers, and therefore we are in the process of remodeling the building through the addition of separating walls and real-life rooms. The size and location of the living space of each individual dog within the Canine Care building is carefully selected to best meet the needs of every resident. A high quality diet is fed to our dogs twice daily, including special foods for those who have unique dietary requirements. We work diligently to reduce the stress levels of the dogs in Canine Care. Indoor enrichment, such as stuffed Kongs, Nylabones, and toys are available to the dogs, and the staff and volunteers interact with the dogs as much as possible including walks through the fields, wading in the ponds, quiet time at an out-of-the-way picnic table, and positive reinforcement training.

It is our belief that if these dogs ever have a chance at a forever home, they must learn basic house manners. Some have a hard time adjusting to life outside of a cage, but eventually, everything falls into place. Many of the dogs need to be taught how to be a dog. That is where our own dogs come into play. They have been a great help in socialising the shy ones. We housebreak them, teach them to walk on leashes, and try to help them adjust to their new life. Our ultimate goal is to place the right dog with the right owner.\r\n\r\nSafehaven was founded 12 years ago, and in that time, we have been a foster home for a the Pekingese Charitable Foundation since 2004, and will continue to do so.

In Corpus Christi, the Society members worked closely with the police officers assigned to humane duties and the City Pound. In 1947, the Society acquired a permanent home.

It was through annual fund drives, rummage sales, charity balls, and similar efforts that the Society was able to pay off the land purchases and build a very fine kennel building.  In 1997, the board of directors decided to revert back to the previous name of Gulf Coast Humane Society. In April 1998, the Society began operating from a new facility.

574,Arlington,"230 McRae Road NE Arlington, WA 98223  Purrfect Pals was born from the tireless dedication of woman who has committed her life to cats: Kathy Centala. Kathy founded Purrfect Pals in 1988, originally as a boarding facility for cats which also helped the occassional homeless cat. Quickly Kathy found herself taking in more and more orphaned cats, overwhelming her small Brier, Washington home.  In the early 1990s Kathy moved Purrfect Pals to a spacious 5 acre spread in rural Arlington, Washington. By converting her new home into a shelter, Kathy was able to provide a comfortable sanctuary to hundreds of cats. And best of all for Kathy, she gets to sleep with 25 cats every night!  Because of our rural location, Purrfect Pals has pioneered off-site adoption events and placement of cats in partner pet stores. In the early years we placed just a few dozen cats every year, but now we've grown to the point where we place more than 2,000 cats every year through our shelter and more than 20 off-site locations across Puget Sound.  The Purrfect Pals sanctuaries have become one of the most important cat resources in all of North America. Our comfortable sanctuary spaces for Feral Cats, cats with Leukemia, cats with FIV, and cats with behavioral issues set a standard for cat comfort and care.  In the late 1990s we opened the Purrfect Pals Cat Hospital on our campus to provide top-quality care for our shelter cats and also to provide free and low-cost spay and neuter surgeries to low-income families. Annually our veterinarians perform more than 2,000 surgeries.  Purrfect Pals has become well-known for our two signature events: the Black Cat Ball and the Average Joe Cat Show. The Black Cat Ball is held the final sunday in October. A gala auction and gourmet dinner, the Black Cat Ball raises money for the shelter. The Average Joe Cat Show is a fun cat show for family cats. The Average Joe Cat Show is held every year in Spring.  In early 2006 Purrfect Pals opened FIV-Land, an innovative cat adoption facilty for cats with FIV. Purrfect Pals is currently adopting about 60 FIV cats a year, 10 times more than any other shelter in the world.",Purrfect Pals,Washington,http://www.purrfectpals.org/,WA,230 McRae Road NE,,Arlington,US,adoption@purrfectpals.org,,48.1918,-122.0858,Purrfect Pals,(360) 652-9611,WA70,WA,98223

Their effort grew into using an old garage for an animal shelter and ultimately led to building a shelter in 1976. At that time, shelter volunteers cared for fewer than 500 animals each year.

Working as the primary small animal caretaker/breeder at the pet store, she learned about the husbandry and special care that went into these little critters.

With the development of her ""Rabbit Room"" K&amp;R was able to lay the ground work for a real sanctuary!  Rebecca, the daughter of a veterinarian, has grown up surrounded by animals of all shapes and sizes. Once old enough to move out on her own, her natural obsession with saving little lives turned into a full-time hobby! During her undergraduate schooling she spent her spare time working with a local shelter providing foster care for orphaned newborn kittens and puppies. While attending medical school in the Caribbean, she was quickly lured into aiding in the set up of a fostering network that utilized the medical students on the island as foster parents for abandoned and abused pets of all kinds!   In 2009 Rebecca and Kristin decided to combine their resources to help the small animals of the Fox Valley who are all to often overlooked by shelters and rescue groups alike. It is Rebecca and Kristin's hopes that one day K&amp;R will be large enough to provide education and understanding, about small animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs, to more pet owners so that these animals do not continue to be ""throw away"" pets but rather as much a part of the family as Man's best friend.",K&R Small Animal Sanctuary,Wisconsin,http://krsmallanimalsanctuary.vpweb.com,WI,,,Oshkosh,US,kr_small_animal_sanctuary@yahoo.com,,44.0247,-88.5425,K&R Small Animal Sanctuary,,WI360,WI,54902

603,Little Chute,"Unforgettable Underdogs Rescue is a volunteer run, 100% foster-based, no-kill dog rescue serving the Northeast Wisconsin area. We are dedicated to rescuing the underdogs, those who have found themselves homeless. We strive to help dogs in public high-kill shelters, those that do not do well in shelters, dogs given up or abandoned by their owners or dogs being abused or neglected.  We find loving, responsible, committed permanent homes. An in-depth adoption process is used, which includes taking considerable care in finding perfect matches and educating potential adopters about the responsibilities of bringing a dog, especially their particular dog, into their life.  Dogs we care for are spayed or neutered, treated for any medical needs they have, and placed into loving foster homes until they find their permanent home. We aim to help distressed dogs, no matter the age or breed.  We are determined to keep overhead expenses extremely low so that the greatest amount possible goes directly to the care of the animals. We vow to take a follow through interest in the dog’s welfare well beyond the adoption process.  Finally, it is our ultimate goal to work with area shelters and other local organizations in order to develop a network of supporters and volunteers in order to create a better world for homeless pets.

606,Cheyenne,"Cheyenne’s only No-Kill animal shelter. We are a small organization run solely on a volunteer basis and funded entirely through donations. BDAR came into existence because of a strongly held belief by its founders. Namely, that no animals should be euthanized in shelters because of population restrictions or because of the length of time it may take to find a permanent home. That said the following mission statement has emerged as a summary of the present and future goals of BDAR. Please Note: ""Black Dog"" is only part of our name - being a black dog is not a requirement to be rescued. Mission:  To provide quality placement and dignified sanctuary for homeless animals in an attempt to end the killing of healthy beings.  The founder’s plan of achieving this mission can be summarized by the following four immediate and long-term goals. Goals:  * Help to end shelter killing of healthy animals by placing companion animals into forever homes. * Actively pursue opportunities to present humane education and promote spay and neuter of companion animals. * Provide life-long, quality sanctuary for non-adoptable companion animals and/or non-releasable wildlife. * Provide support and help to unify other humane efforts and organizations.",Black Dog Animal Rescue,Wyoming,http://www.bdar.org,WY,3619 Evans Ave. Ste.
