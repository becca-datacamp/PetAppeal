28,nan,Decatur,"Decatur, AL Phone: 256-351-1862  My name is Bettina Rister, and I am 27 years old. Almost 12 years ago, I purchased a Scottish Terrier from a ""breeder"" in Alabama. It turned out that ""breeder"" was what most people refer to as a ""puppy miller"". She was breeding about 12 different types of dogs and didn't even allow us to see the mother when we looked at the puppies. The puppy I bought that day, changed my life forever. She had tons of medical problems, red mange, allergies, thyroid deficiency, and eventually succumbed to cancer just a few short months ago at the age of 11 1/2, far too young for a Scottie to be dying. She taught me about training, she taught me patience, and she brought to my attention the need for rescue. We spent untold sums on keeping her healthy, and I often wondered what happened to her siblings had they gone to homes not as dedicated as ours were or as financially able to provide for them. It was this driving worry that prompted me to start doing rescue.   STRNA, or Scottish Terrier Rescue of North Alabama was officially formed in 1995 and has since rescued and placed or helped in placing dozens of dogs in new homes. I decided to concentrate my rescue efforts and keep myself from being overwhelmed, so I dedicated myself to Scottish Terrier rescue.   I rescued my first Scottie almost 6 years ago. She was a stray, and in terrible shape. I took her to the vet's office and she was running a very high fever. Her hair was missing from her shoulders back, she was skinny and covered in fleas and ticks. The vet's were worried that she might have distemper. It was nearly 3 weeks before she began to recover, but she pulled through very well. She now lives with her adoptive family and has a wonderful life. Her owners named her Madeleine. Since then I have rescued many more animals, not all Scotties, and found them permanent loving homes as well.",Scottish Terrier Rescue of North Alabama,Alabama,http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/strna.html,AL

The club also sponsors a rescue effort to save Siberian Huskies that otherwise may be turned out on the street or face euthanasia in shelters. Founded in 1987, the efforts of those volunteering their time to Siberian Husky rescue in the bay area have been exceptionally successful--finding homes for a high percentage of the Siberians who enter the program.   Finding good homes and responsible owners for lost and abandoned Siberians is only part of the group's efforts. In addition, Bay Area Siberian Husky Rescue Referral (BASHRR) provides direction to information, training tips, and advice to owners in need of solving problems with their dogs in order to help them find alternatives to surrendering their pets.

As the needs of the community's animals shifted throughout subsequent decades, education programs, community pet support programs and a veterinary hospital were added. BEBHS closed the veterinary practice to the public in early 2009 to focus on providing medical care exclusively for shelter dogs and cats, making it the first veterinary hospital in the East Bay to serve only homeless animals.  In the 1970s, the Board of Directors committed to a revolutionary adoption guarantee model: that no healthy or treatable shelter animals would be euthanized in the Society's care. This commitment set the stage for BEBHS placing 100% of healthy and treatable animals into loving homes for nearly forty years, a commitment that awarded BEBHS and partner organizations the prestigious Maddie's Fund Lifesaving Award in 2009.",Berkeley East Bay Humane Society,California,http://www.berkeleyhumane.org,CA

224,90266,Manhattan Beach,"Noah's B'ark is determined to do all that we can to fight against the great tragedy that is taking place on a daily basis in the animal shelters of the greater Los Angeles area. In these shelters alone, an average of 475 defenseless animals have their lives taken away from them, or as the shelters like to put it, they are ""humanely euthanized"". As terrible as this is, we cannot put the blame solely on the shelters. The fact of the matter is that we have a pet overpopulation problem, and there just aren't enough people out there willing to give these animals a chance to be their best friend and the loving companion that these animals would love the opportunity to become.  Our goal is to help provide as many of these animals with the second chance on life that they deserve. Though we are a small organization, we save as many dogs and cats as we possibly can. Quite often, these animals are rescued within hours of their pending demise. Once they are in our care, we provide these lucky few with the medical care that they may need, and we place them with loving foster families. The foster family cares for their new friend while a loving and responsible owner is carefully searched for. While in our care, the animal will be spayed or neutered, because we strongly feel that this is the only true solution to the pet overpopulation problem.",Noah's Bark Pet Rescue,California,http://noahs-bark.org/,CA
225,94955,Petaluma,"We are a group of dedicated volunteers committed to the rescue of dogs from crisis situations. Some of these situations include euthanasia by animal shelters, neglect and other forms of abuse, potential use in research laboratory testing, or use as bait for the training of fighting dogs.  Our rescued animals are immediately placed in foster homes, not kennels. Foster homes are the most crucial yet challenging ingredient to our rescue efforts. Without available foster homes, many dogs are unable to be rescued. However with foster homes, each dog is provided a nurturing home environment that includes food, shelter, exercise, and, most importantly, love. These animals come to understand that the safest place in the world is in the arms of their caretakers. Once the dog is ready, she or he is adopted into a thoroughly screened, caring, and permanent home.  You may ask, ""What is so unique about NBCR&amp;P, and why would one choose to adopt from, volunteer with, or contribute to NBCR&amp;P?"" The bottom line with most rescue groups is the welfare of our canine companions, so in that respect we are no different than anyone else. However, unlike many other organizations, we do take special care with very sick or injured animals. We have, on occasion, taken dogs from shelters that have broken bones, epilepsy, internal malformations, drastic skin problems, pneumonia, and other ailments--some life threatening. We spare no expense with vet care in doing what is required to help these animals as long as we are reasonably sure that the dog, once brought back to health, can lead a quality, pain-free life. We choose to rescue without discrimination as to health and we stand behind (and go into hoc for) that decision.",North Bay Canine Rescue & Placement,California,http://www.northbay-canine.org/,CA

Examples of some of the ways we take in/rescue animals:  Owner gives up pet  Pet is abandoned  Pet is rescued from abuse  Dogs/Cats/Puppies/Kittens found on the streets and we are unable to locate the owner  Volunteers at a shelter request help in placing a pet that needs a chance  We have a very aggressive adoption program. We carefully screen each prospective ""Pet Parent"" and spaying and Neutering is a requirement of each adoption. We vaccinate all of our animals and take care of any known medical requirements.

When we rescue a pet, they stay in our kennel or foster homes until they are adopted.  We also have a trap spay/neuter program.

It is a humane, educational institution which is trying to systematically deal with the problems faced by the homeless, stray,abused, unwanted and neglected cat. It is the largest, oldest and most well-known charitable organization in the United States that deals solely with the cat. Its aims are to confront the problems of the feline and through education, enable the cat to live a richer, fuller and happier life.  One of the most basic philosophies which is constantly disseminated to the public is the necessity of neutering and spaying. Coupled with the need for population control is the fact that neutered cats live a happier and safer life. The neutered pet does not spray or call for a mate and unbredwhole females chance developing an often fatal uterine infection. We are by no means alone in this precept; many humane societies also preach the neuter/spay concept. But we go further than most do. We feel that the catis entitled to proper veterinary care, a good, nourishing diet, healthful,enjoyable surroundings and plenty of love and attention. We try to educate the public on the entire proper care of the cat and deal with all types of questions from nutrition to behavioral problems. We also directly confront head-on the controversy regarding the indoor/outdoor cat. We feel that the only safe, proper, loving environment for a cat is one in which he is kept strictly indoors at all times, unless he is in a completely cat-proof-screened patio or the like or is walked on a harness.

The Rescue House also pays for the microchip registration and 30 days of pet insurance for each cat and kitten that is adopted. The adoption fee assists us in covering these costs.

259,94551,Livermore,"For decades in Romania street dogs have been killed in vain attempts to control their population, using barbaric methods as the most usual way of killing the animals. As we have noticed, the animals keep repopulating regardless of the killing. When dogs are killed in an area, others move into the area and repopulate it. So the vicious cycle of killing animals does not work. Only Catch Neuter and Return has been proven to decrease the unwanted street dog population. When 80% of the dogs are sterilized, there is a 0% population growth. Sterilization (spay/neuter) is a win-win. It humanely decreases the unwanted street dog population, eventually eliminating it altogether.  As many of you are aware, spaying and neutering are the only true means to control unwanted animal births. This includes spay/neuter of owned dogs as well as strays. Often owned dogs are allowed out of doors off leash, contributing to the population of unwanted litters of puppies. A proactive public measure to spay/neuter not only strays but also owned and breed dogs will quickly diminish the unwanted stray dog population. Did you know that one female dog and her offspring can produce up to 67,000 puppies in six years? And dogs that have been neutered are less aggressive, and tend not to roam in packs. Spay/neuter is also the kindest measure one can take to ensure the overall health of the animal. Spay/neuter can eliminate the onset of many tumors and cancers, including testicular and prostate cancer in male dogs and mammary cancers in female dogs.

It was my hope to make a difference by providing a home for one of my favorite furry friends.  Before I knew it, I was put on a rescue email list and received a message stating, “This dog to be put down on Tuesday at 3pm”. I was utterly horrified and jumped into action, trying to figure out how I could save her. Well save her I did and I’m glad to report Raspberry (my nephew named her) is living happily in Encinitas to this day! After getting her adopted, I thought, “Well, that wasn’t so tough.” And so it goes…5 years later and more than 1,200 dogs adopted into loving homes…we have The Barking Lot.

300,94598,Walnut Creek,"The catalyst for ARF came in May of 1990 during a baseball game between the Oakland Athletics and the New York Yankees when a stray cat wandered onto the playing field. Terrified by the roar of the crowd, the frightened feline dashed about, eluding umpires and players. Tony, then the Manager of the Oakland A's, coaxed the cat into the dugout, secured its safety for the remainder of the game, then took responsibility for placing it with a local shelter. To his dismay, Tony discovered there was not a single No-Kill facility in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. When Tony learned the cat would be euthanized, he and his wife, Elaine, named her ""Evie"" and found a home for her. His experience with this cat was the genesis for the founding of ARF, a No-Kill organization dedicated to bringing people and animals together to enrich each others lives.  As life-long animal advocates with a deep concern for the thousands of animals abandoned to shelters each year, Tony and Elaine were inspired to create ARF in 1991. Their goal was to find caring homes for these animals and educate the public about the importance of controlling pet over-population through spay and neuter programs. Since then, ARF's mission has been expanded to include many outreach programs. It is only through a comprehensive approach that includes public education, early spay/neuter, and community involvement that ARF will achieve Tony and Elaine's ultimate vision of no more homeless, unwanted pets.",Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation,California,http://www.tlr-arf.org,CA

From these ingredients, the Fort Collins Cat Rescue &amp; Spay/Neuter Clinic was born on June 1, 2006.  The original 17 cats came from another animal rescue group that didn't have the means to care for them. The fear of those cats going to the Humane Society and being euthanized, forced Sarah Swanty &amp; Anna Neubauer to finally act on their dream of opening a no-kill cat rescue. With a background in the veterinary field, and the support of South Mesa Veterinary Hospital, the two women were able to provide the necessary care for the kitties while they waited for adopters.  In no time at all, the word about the no-kill cat rescue spread, and calls started pouring in for cats that needed help. When one cat would get adopted, another would be moved into the shelter immediately. Kittens started arriving in bundles, and a foster program was immediately started. (The foster program consisted mainly of Sarah and Anna and their friends.)   Address: 2321 E.

Box 312 Wilton, CT 06897 203.762.2006 In the 1960's Animals In Distress was founded as a humane organization to care for all animals in need - dogs were housed by Basil Burt, Wilton's dog warden at the time. Cats and other animals were fostered by organization members. By 1975, nature groups were providing for the care of wild animals and the Town of Wilton had created a dog shelter and so Animals In Distress became an organiztion dedicated exclusively to cats. Animals In Distress settled in the 6'x9' dog shelter's furnace room (to which, thankfully, a window was added). Occupancy was limited to only eight cats, so any overflow, including kittens were placed in foster care.   By 1986, Wilton constructed a new animal shelter behind the Wilton Town Hall where the present day shelter is now located. Now at any given time, Animals In Distress cares for between 20 to 30 cats in the large sunny corner room and kitchen that is The Basil Burt Animal Shelter. With the exception of kittens who are still placed in foster homes, few, if any of our felines live off-site of the shelter.  Animals In Distress is a non-profit organization staffed solely by volunteers who are at the shelter no less than twice a day, every day of the week. Our volunteers participate in the feeding, cleaning and general duties of care associated with providing an environment of love and well being to our residents. =^..^=",Animals In Distress,Connecticut,http://www.animals-in-distress.com/,CT

389,67590,Litchfield,"MEOW INC. was founded in April, 1984. Our founding focus was (and still is) the plight of colony cats. Colony cats are unowned cats that exist in high enough numbers to make their care cost-prohibitive to most individual caregivers. They also run the risk of being persecuted as public health nuisances. MEOW INC. was organized to help these cats and concerned caregivers in a way consistent with humane ethics.  Through MEOW's efforts, colony cats were examined and tested for contagious diseases then vaccinated, altered and treated for parasites. All healthy feral cats (cats that are unsocialized to humans) were returned to their colonies. Kittens, most juveniles, geriatric cats and any friendly felines were placed into foster homes for subsequent adoption. In the later 1980's and early 1990's this type of colony cat work became much more accepted. It is called Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR). Much of MEOW's time and energy is still devoted to this work.

A kind veterinarian believed in and supported our “no-kill” philosophy and gave us $5 spay/neuter surgeries.

Dagmara decided to start volunteering after work and on the weekends for various rescue shelters and found out that there was a sad reality to the treatment of dogs in our society; this new reality was in many ways caused by the current economical situation of the moment, in which many families lost their homes, couldn't afford to keep their dogs or the more sinister side of this problem which was the outright abuse of dogs for entertainment purposes.  Dagmara decided to open a Facebook Page simple named Rescue Adoption in order to prevent any dog from being euthanized at any cost, many friends helped spread the word and a page that started with one friend gained thousands within a few months... With the strong response of new like minded friends and the ability to utilize social media as a medium to spread the word and feature dogs that were in need of a new home.

607,30830,Waynesboro,"The Mission of Old Fella Burke County Animal Rescue is to assist as many abandoned companion animals as possible. However, we are not in the animal control business. Animal control is a government service, paid for by the taxpayers of the community to pick up abandoned or nuisance animals, often referred to as “strays.” We operate under a “rescue” license from The Georgia Department of Agriculture, a state agency that has very specific laws dictating the intake procedure we must follow when taking in animals. Our license with the Georgia Department of Agriculture prohibits us from taking in “stray” animals; these animals must be picked up by an agency licensed to do so, such as animal control. In order for us to legally take in an animal, it must be surrendered to us in writing, by someone claiming to be its owner. If you know of a purely “stray” animal you would like to see removed, you must contact your local animal control agency or Sheriff’s department (if your county does not have animal control).  Old Fella Burke County Animal Rescue believes we have a responsibility to our community to educate the public on proper animal care. Our members are happy to share whatever knowledge we have on providing companion animals with proper food, water, shelter and veterinary care to anyone who asks. However, we are not authorized to investigate cases of animal cruelty and neglect. These cases need to be reported to your local law enforcement and to your local animal control agency. While we take a firm stance against anyone that would harm or neglect an animal, we are not law enforcement. If you witness or suspect animal cruelty, please take the time to report it to your local animal control agency and your local police. This is a very serious crime and is punishable by law.  As stated in our Bylaws, the mission of this organization is:  * To prevent cruelty to animals * To provide humane education materials to children and the general public * To promote early, aggressive spay/neuter programs * To increase the quality of life of unwanted and homeless animals by providing necessary care and seeking suitable homes through adoption * To work cooperatively with local, state and national rescue/shelter groups with similar objectives * To be ""no kill"" in philosophy, wherein euthanasia is performed only for medical necessity, as well as public safety, as determined by a veterinarian * To never knowingly allow any animal in our care to undergo any experimentation or to release any animal for such experimentation   Mailing Address: PO Box 1437 Waynesboro, GA 30830  Call Us: (888) 846-3792",Old Fella Burke County Animal Rescue,Georgia,http://www.oldfella.org/,GA

The Hawaii Dog Foundation is a 501(c) 3 nonprofit corporation on Oahu whose primary goal is to ensure that every dog in Hawaii is given the chance to live out its natural life in peace, safety, and contentment. Our immediate goal is to continue taking in homeless dogs, using our foster care network, and finding permanent, loving homes for them. Our intermediate goal is to open a ""no kill"" shelter to accommodate the increasing number of dogs we receive. Our long-term goal, our dream, is to open a sanctuary where, additionally, we will be able to permanently house those dogs who, for whatever reason, are not adoptable. In order to achieve these goals we will be involved in various fundraising activities throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Results of our fundraising efforts will help in providing food, transportation and support for our foster families as well as advertising costs involved in finding permanent homes for all homeless dogs in Hawaii.  We LOVE 'em all! Big Dogs, Small Dogs, Medium Dogs! Whether they are short haired or long haired, purebreds, mutts or poi dogs, house dogs or yard dogs! Canines of every shape, size and color!

Since then, the homeless population has exploded in numbers. We saw an extreme need for our presence out there. Originally, our main focus of being out there was to keep watch over these dogs to make sure that they are being properly cared for. At times, some of these dogs don't get dog food unless we provide it.  We cannot stop. We will not stop. These dogs need us. We now are able to provide more dog food, first-aid care, medications, flea/tick shampoo and linens to help keep these helpless souls warm from the cold ocean air. We offer spay/neuter and micro chipping for all the dogs and puppies. We educate the homeless about the positive health benefits of spay/neuter, and of course, encourage no more puppies on the beaches.

Animal control was handled by law enforcement and they were overwhelmed with the amount of unwanted and running at large dogs. The city pound was simply not big enough and they did not have the funding to house all the unclaimed dogs. As many pounds do, they were forced to euthanize due to lack of space, which was just not acceptable to Kate and Alice; therefore, the inception of SCAA. Being lifelong animal lovers it seemed only natural to assist with animal care and give the dogs of Boundary County a better chance at life. Alice and her husband, at their own expense, built kennels in their large indoor barn and soon were fostering dogs for the City Pound. Not long after, volunteers severed ties with the City Pound and officially became SCAA.  Driven by its mission, SCAA is now a formidable force in Bonners Ferry. The Organization is now beginning to realize its dream of constructing a shelter to house dogs and cats and well as building a strong foster care program.

Because our animals are cared for in people’s homes we do require an adoption application prior to visiting so that we can learn more about you. There is no time limit for any animal’s stay with us. We are committed to finding the right home, and to taking the time to carefully match the needs and the personalities of both people and adopted animals. If your interested in meeting any of our animals, please can click on the “adoptables’ tab to read more information or the “forms” tab to complete the on-line adoption application. You can can also check out our facebook page. We post many of our animals on facebook even before we put them on petfinder.  FOSTERS HOMES ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO SAVE MORE ANIMALS. We can only save an animal with a foster home. Please consider opening your heart and your home to an animal in need. We provide food, crate, xpen, all the medical, toys and bones. If your considering fostering, please fill out a foster application which is located under the “forms” tab. We would love to talk with you more about fostering.

692,61601,Peoria,"Foster Pet Outreach began in 1990 when three coworkers banded together to help a stray cat. Recognizing the need to better the lives of abandoned and abused animals in their community, they volunteered as a small group at the Peoria Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). Charter members helped clean cages, groom animals, walk dogs, and fostered selected animals in their homes. In 1991 a growing membership incorporated as an independent organization known as A Cause for Paws (ACFP). While ACFP was beginning to be recognized in the community, there was also confusion with PAWS because of the name similarity. Although the name was changed to Foster Pet Outreach in 1995, the commitment to placing animals in permanent homes remains the same. Over fifty animals are placed into loving homes each year by our organization. 2007 marks our seventeenth year dedicated to helping animals in need.

H.E.L.P. is not an animal shelter. The animals live in our volunteer’s homes. We feel that providing foster care in a home benefits the animal and the potential adopter. By fostering, we can work on health or behavioral issues with the animal, and the cat or dog may live in a loving, healthful environment until a suitable adoptive home is found. In addition, fostering gives us a better idea of what type of home would be the best match for the cat or dog.   Homeless pets are referred by police departments, veterinarians, other shelters and people in the community. Each animal is first taken to a veterinarian for a thorough examination, vaccinations, worming, and spaying or neutering. They are then taken to a foster home for recovery from surgery, if necessary, socialization and evaluation.   H.E.L.P. is essentially a no-kill organization. We do not have time limits on the animals in our care and we do not euthanize animals with health issues or non-terminal illness. However, we will not prolong the suffering of an animal with a personality that would make living in a home with people a miserable experience. Furthermore, we do not keep animals in foster care whose temperament poses a danger to people or other animals.

701,60618,Chicago,"PO Box 18098 Chicago, IL 60618-0098  Frustrated with the short time limits imposed at Chicago's animal shelters in the 1960's, a small group of animal lovers began rescuing and adopting out cats and kittens on their own.   In 1970, they founded the not-for-profit organization, Animal Protective Association, with the motto of “Caring, not Killing.” For seven years, our founders would foster their rescued cats in their own homes, at veterinary hospitals, and even in the back of a small resale shop on Clark Street.   A generous bequest in 1977 enabled us to purchase a two-story building on Wrightwood Avenue, with large airy rooms for the cats to play and relax, and side rooms for admission and isolation areas. The warmth of this home-like environment allowed adopters to get to know all the cats before choosing a new pet. They could see for themselves who is a cuddly lapcat, or who wants to chase and wrestle with a cat buddy.   In 1988, we relocated to our current Kedzie Avenue location, with three full floors for the cats and kittens to run and jump, and with multi-tiered cat trees on every floor. APA adopted the name Harmony House for Cats to reflect the gentle nature of this unique haven for cats. We also adopted our new hugging cats logo, designed by Margrit Fiddle, as a symbol of a cat's ability to live peacefully in a communal setting.

We truly are a cageless, no-kill shelter. We also actively participate in TNR to manage the many feral cat colonies…sometimes relocating entire colonies for their own health and/or safety. We are the ONLY ones for miles and miles around who offer this help for feral cats. Most either turn a blind eye, or trap them only to have them euthanized...

742,61264,Milan,"724 West Second Avenue Milan, Illinois 61264   We operate the Quad City Animal Welfare Center as a No-Kill shelter. There are many different understandings and definitions surrounding the term ""No-Kill"". Our center operates under the philosophy that we serve our community as a supplement to our local animal controls. While animal control shelters are funded with tax dollars, they are required to control the pet population, and unfortunately that often involves euthanasia. By accepting approximately 50 percent of our animals from local animal control shelters, they do not have to euthanize the animal because there is no room. Our community is benefited by our willingness to accept, alter, vaccinate, and care for each animal until it can be adopted. Without our shelter, these animals would be otherwise be euthanized.  As the no-kill movement continues to grow, there are many debates regarding the terminology of ""No-Kill"". There are animal control shelters that state ""no-kill"" shelters are really not no-kill because they cannot accept every animal that comes into their facility. This belief is shared by a national humane organization which actively speaks out against no-kill shelters and condemns the words ""no-kill"". They believe that no-kill shelters should be referred to as ""limited admission shelters"". Unfortunately, when shelters spend time condemning other shelters, it is the animals for which they were created to care for who ultimately suffer.  It is our position that we will not pass judgment on any shelter who works towards the improvement of animal welfare. Each shelter in a community has a role and responsibility to fulfill, while they may have different philosophies and missions, in the end, we share a common goal, to help the animals of our community.   If we as a no-kill shelter did not exist, the animals that we accept and care for would be relinquished to the animal control, thus increasing the burden on them and the tax payers as well as increasing their euthansia rates.  We will help and work with any shelter who is committed to improving animal welfare. We have actively provided assistance, shared information and experiences with both no-kill shelters as well as animal control shelters across the country. Only together will we move closer to ending the suffering for all animals and thus eliminate the need for euthanasia.",Quad City Animal Welfare Center,Illinois,http://www.qcawc.org/,IL

At that time, a small group of volunteers working from their homes gathered information and maintained records for the purpose of reuniting lost companion animals and their owners.  Soon animal control officials in various townships and counties requested our help in locating the owners of unclaimed strays that were being held at their facilities. Over the next 10 years, as both demand and support for our services grew, WSHS began sheltering homeless animals by opening a small storefront shelter on Chicago's west side along with 3 additional small satellite shelters in other townships. Today, we have consolidated into one easily accessible and highly visible shelter and adoption facility, housing up to 25 dogs and 60 cats at a time.

The cats and dogs come to us from many sources. Impoundment facilities and the public bring us dogs and cats from all ages who have been abandoned, abused, injured, neglected, and orphaned. A dedicated volunteer base and the retained services of several veterinarians has allowed us to save the lives of and place over 1,200 homeless animals each year into new homes. Every animal that is brought to our shelter receives whatever type of veterinary care that is needed, including surgery and hospitalization for trauma cases, long-term care and medication for viral and bacterial infections, and treatment of parasite infestations such as heartworm.

Just think what this group of hard-working staff and wonderful volunteers could accomplish if they could move into the much more efficient, new, and well-designed structure! Following are where we (amazingly) are today: But read it and realize where we could (even more amazingly) be tomorrow with your help!  Since 2007 we have INCREASED adoptions by 22%...that is phenomenal in this economy, and when compared to other shelters in the state and nationally, we are above average in that rate.  Our return rate is almost miniscule when compared to those other shelters too. That means more people are getting healthier and better matched pets and are not returning them to us. This has long been one of our goals and it is working!  You will be impressed when you learn that since 2007 we have DECREASED our euthanization rate almost 35%. This is possible because of our herculean efforts to find good homes for our pets, our efforts to CURE more of what sometimes ails them, and our refusal to put animals down because we have no space. It also means we are running a cleaner and healthier shelter. This also sometimes takes tremendous effort and help from our community, but everyone stepping up to the plate has made this incredible improvement. Thank you!  The AWL does not put down treatable or healthy non-aggressive pets.

The Frieds came to the United States in 1939 from Nazi Germany. In the late 1970's they sold their home in Beverly Shores, Indiana to buy an old roadside motel in Michigan City, Indiana. They turned the motel into a no-kill, cageless shelter for homeless and abandoned felines.   The Frieds did not believe in euthanization as a solution to the cat overpopulation problem. Hans became known by his favorite saying:  ""To save a life is more in conformity with God's law than to kill""  Hans and Lucille felt that spaying and neutering would correct the problem and be a much more humane solution. It was their dream to create a safe haven for all felines who needed it.  The Frieds passed away over ten years ago, but their legacy is still being carried out today by our Board of Directors. Fried's Cat Shelter is still a no-kill, cageless sanctuary that thoroughly believes in spaying and neutering as the most effective method to control the feline population.",Fried's Cat Shelter,Indiana,http://friedscatshelter.org/,IN

They've never had proper veterinary care, training or companionship. They've lived outside, in a crate, or in a basement, or have been dumped in the country to fend for themselves. They're scared, depressed and anxious. Some are angry, some are sick, some have given up. But, we at Northeast Iowa Pet Rescue do NOT give up on an animal.

Description Boudreaux’s Animal Rescue Krewe (B.A.R.K.) is a local 501c(3) non-profit animal welfare organization and NO KILL animal shelter. We are determined and inspired to rescue homeless and/or unwanted dogs that are due to be euthanized merely because there are too many dogs in shelters.

Please contact us or visit our website barkdogrescue.org if you would be interested in any aspect of helping, fostering, or adopting these precious animals. General Information Husband and wife team, Julian and Eva Long, have rescued animals all of their lives, but one day in 2004, when Julian was exposed to a local animal shelter’s day of euthanasia, he adopted ten dogs from “Death Row;” and the two have never looked back. The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina hit one year later, and their shelter was overflowing with abandoned animals. Years have passed, and their incredible journey is on-going. Over 3000 dogs have been rescued and placed in their forever homes, but so many more continue to come. Both, born and raised in Louisiana, they are very proud of their heritage. They love the southern traditions, the food, and the beautiful land, but regretfully admit that animals are not always treated as they should be. Sometimes they are treated like property and are kept on short chains. Others run loose, and the shelters are full of homeless pets. The main message that they would like to express is the importance of spaying and neutering animals to help reduce the pet overpopulation. That is the main reason we have shelters and so many innocent animals killed. ---------------------------- Currently we are more active on our facebook page than the website but eventually we will be trying to keep the two in sync.

Given the space and resources, we will take in just about any type of animal that can be considered a pet. Not just your average dogs and cats, but we have also had sheep, goats, horses, pot bellied pigs, turkeys, chicken, pheasants, and various other fowl. We have also had numerous small furry rodents and a scaly creature or two. We are currently home for a miniature horse, a lama and a beautiful pair of emu. We have taken in animals from other states as well. At the moment we have cats from Seattle, Dallas, Boston, Utah, and Lelani came to us all the way from Hawaii. Now, not all of these animals are available for adoption. When we take in an animal, we feel we are making a commitment to caring for that animal for the rest of it's natural life. We will asses that animals character and temperament as well as it's physical and emotional needs to determine its adoptability. If there are no barriers to adoption, a suitable home will be sought. This could take days, weeks, or months. We have had some animals in our program for years before just the right home came along. And if the right home does not present itself, we will simply keep that critter ourselves, giving it all the loving attention it needs.

The three things that are considered when making this decision are the age, temperament, and health of the animal. If the animal is deemed adoptable, it is given an estimated duration at the shelter. The pets that are deemed un-adoptable are rejected and slated to be euthanized. This is where we step in.

1042,81060,Audobon,"A good samaritan approached a known animal-loving woman and explained to her that she knew of a wild kitten, somehow surviving outside without the use of her hind legs. What caused this, we will never know, but this is how Joa the paraplegic kitten came into one animal rescuer’s life and heart.   Though she had no use of her legs and little control of her bladder, Joa was a ball of fire – zipping around, playing hard and generally causing lovable havoc wherever she went. She is the perfect example of the fact that these special animals have no idea they are “handicap” and they are no less deserving of a loving home of their own. Sadly, not long after being adopted into a wonderful home, Joa passed away.  Joa's Arc wishes to help provide the opportunity, to pets like Joa, to know the love she had and provided. Some facts:  - Shelters have a very large number of animals coming into their facilities every day. - A lot of those animals also happen to have “special needs” ranging from broken bones to birth defects. - With so many healthy animals to worry about and very few resources, shelters cannot consider spending money on these special needs animals   Mailing Address: PO Box 243 Audubon, NJ 08106",Joa's Arc,New-Jersey,http://joasarc.blogspot.com/,NJ

1052,78520,Brownsville,"1915 Route 46 West  Ledgewood, NJ 07852  Noah's Ark was founded in 1966 as a small rescue group. A handful of dedicated, compassionate individuals met the challenge to alleviate the pain and suffering and give a second chance to countless homeless animals often the victims of indifference and a result of pet overpopulation.   It was the dream of Mildred Wien, founder of Noah's Ark to open a shelter where these poor, forgotten waifs could find safety and care until a new home could be found for them. Members fostered the rescued animals in their homes and in the basement of a Boonton thrift shop, Noah's Nook and Cranny, which was also headquarters for the growing association. News spread of their work and their numbers grew. For over ten years they tenaciously worked toward their dream while continuing their mission. Fundraisers of all sorts were launched including elegant garden parties and house tours, lawn sales, mass appeals in newspapers, and networking with community resources and leaders.  Spaying and neutering of pets was aggressively promoted. Noah's Ark was a pioneer in this critical animal welfare area, establishing a spay/neuter financial assistance program early on. In 1971, the Pet Adoption Promise commenced asking adopters to sign an agreement to spay/neuter their pet, give proper vet care and provide a happy, healthy environment.",Noah's Ark Animal Welfare Association,New-Jersey,http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/NJ69.html,NJ
1053,70030,Des Allemands,"The history of North Jersey Humane Society goes back to before the opening of our Bloomfield shelter. It all started in 2011 when Bergen County Humane Enforcement, an animal control agency, asked itself two questions: “What happens to the animals we rescue? Do they end up in happy homes, or do they end up on a kill list at an animal shelter?” With those questions in mind, some members of the BCHE set out to open their own animal shelter where they knew no animal would be euthanized because of their age, temperament or length of stay. The result was Bergen County Protect &amp; Rescue, a true no-kill shelter in Cliffside Park, NJ. Since its opening in 2011, Bergen County Protect &amp; Rescue has operated as a small community-oriented, volunteer-based, non-profit 501(c)(3) animal shelter. They have successfully rehomed hundreds of animals annually of various breeds, ages and temperaments to happy homes. However, the very small size of the shelter had prompted a need to expand. And so, North Jersey Humane Society, a subsidiary of BCP&amp;R, was born!  In November 2014, North Jersey Humane Society took over the existing Bloomfield Animal Shelter and reopened it as a true no-kill animal shelter. This facilty sits on a large piece of land with much more space for the shelter animals. Renovation planning phase is just about complete. The plans are a massive undertaking; however, we welcome the challenge. We have already expanded our volunteer program, and future plans include a large fenced area for dogs to socialize and be trained; a feral cat village (Wild Wild West), and an on-site clinic, just to name a few. North Jersey Humane Society plans to replicate and expand on the success it experienced as Bergen County Protect &amp; Rescue. We look forward to serving the Essex County Area!

As funds allowed the Society expanded to include a free medical clinic and a small adoption center for cats and dogs. Today our hospital and our Vladimir Horowitz and Wanda Toscanini Horowitz Adoption Center help more than 38,000 dogs and cats annually, and their numbers continue to grow.  At the Society, the quality of each animal's life is paramount. Long before it was popular to think of animals as individuals - to consider their physical and emotional needs when taking responsibility for their care - we were doing just that. That means every day, every dog gets exercise time in the rooftop run, and the chance to walk outdoors with staff and volunteers. Cats enjoy daily play sessions outside their kennels. This very personal care is fully as important to a pet's well being as the inoculations, spay/neuter and other veterinary care provided during its stay in the adoption center.

The shelter had housed over 1,100 animals. The conditions were poor and many of the animals were not socialized in positive ways. This resulted in many dogs that were not only afraid of people but aggressive toward them. The behaviors of the dogs were not their fault. They were a result of neglect. Pets Alive knew they had to change this. They knew they could. It would take years to get to the place that they want to be in regard to reducing the amount of animals though adoptions, finding forever homes for seniors, foster homes for hospice animals and fixing the run down facility and old kennels. But, they knew that in time that the place that had a negative reputation in the community would come to have a positive one through their dedication to the animals and efforts to improve their lives.   Pets Alive can proudly say that since 2010 many positive changes have happened. The animals have an excellent quality of life. The population is reduced to fewer than 200 from the 1,100 that were there when Pets Alive came in. Pets Alive turned what was a shelter into a sanctuary.

From the website: ""The Tompkins County SPCA was incorporated in February 1902 in an effort to prosecute individual cases of cruelty. In 1904, the organization acquired sheltering facilities and took over as pound master for some of the municipalities within the county. For much of its history, the SPCA has employed humane officers to investigate individual cases of cruelty, as well as providing impound, sheltering and adoption of unwanted dogs, cats, and other animals.   In 1999, the SPCA Board of Directors resolved to become a ""no kill"" shelter, while maintaining its animal control contracts with local municipalities. Currently, the SPCA has contracts for animal control with all townships, the City of Ithaca, the local Health Department, and the County for stray dog control, stray cat control, suspected rabid animal quarantine, cruelty enforcement, and the enforcement of local and state statutes regarding dogs.   After reducing the death rate over 50% in a single year, the SPCA finished 2001 saving 100% of healthy dogs and cats for the first time in its 100 year history, and an important first step toward realizing its No Kill vision. In 2002, the SPCA further saved 100% of healthy and treatable dogs and cats--the first county in the nation to do so--and has maintained that standard ever since. Animal People, a prominent national journal on animal issues, ranked Tompkins County the safest community for companion animals in the United States.   In Spring of 2004, the SPCA opened the Dorothy and Roy Park Pet Adoption Center, a sheltering facility that provides dogs and cats with comfortable, healthy, home-like settings. The Adoption Center also has a surgery suite, dog walking trails, as well as training and play spaces. Registered as the nation's first ""green"" animal shelter (U.S. Green Building Council) for its environmentally minded, sustainable design, the facility is ""good for people, good for animals, and good for the planet.""

We, along with our veterinarian, make an in-depth assessment of any medical conditions, which are treated at once. Pregnant moms are assisted with whelping (which most of the time is during the middle of the night). All too frequently the mom is emaciated and unable to provide milk for her babies; the puppies are then placed on round-the-clock bottle feeding.  Before becoming available for adoption, the mom will be spayed, dewormed, tested for heartworm &amp; lyme disease, vaccinated, and started on heartworm &amp; flee prevention.

1293,44309,Akron,"Tri-County Animal Protective League was started in late 1997. Our goal is to provide shelter, medical care, and adoption services to animals in need in Stark, Summit and Portage counties in Ohio. In 1998, our first full year, we found new homes for 130 cats and 91 dogs. As of the end of 2004, we have adopted out 1,136 cats/kittens, and 369 dogs/puppies.  The Difference  The difference between the Tri-County Animal Protective League and many other animal shelters is that we support a no-time-limit policy based upon the individual animal's needs. This means that we will not euthanize an animal just because it has been with us for longer than ""X"" number of days. Euthanasia is used only when an animal has an incurable disease (such as FeLV or FIV for cats), is suffering from a serious illness or injury with no hope of recovery, or has severe behavior problems.  Our Purpose  Here at Tri-County APL, we strive to reduce the number of abused or abandoned animals. We carefully screen potential adopters to make sure they are ready for a new pet, and that they are matched with a pet that fits their home and lifestyle. All animals are adopted out as indoor pets only. Any animal that is old enough is altered before it is adopted. People adopting puppies and kittens must agree to have them altered as soon as they are old enough. We educate all potential adopters, giving information on such things as crate training for dogs, introducing their new pet to their home, and general dog and cat care. We especially stress the importance of spaying and neutering.",Tri County Animal Protective League,Ohio,http://tricountyapl.mysaga.net/,OH

1343,97330,Corvallis,"We do qualify as no-kill based on our actions, policies, and save rates. However, we refer to ourselves as an “open door facility” and we do not call ourselves no-kill. The reason is we are the only facility-based animal welfare organization in Benton County, Oregon. As such, we are a private non-profit AND we serve as the municipal shelter on behalf of the city and the county. We never turn an animal away. We receive strays, impounds, surrendered, and seized animals. Some of these animals have significant injuries or behavioral issues. We always evaluate and euthanasia is always a last option. We spent the past several years developing an amazing network of foster volunteers and relationships with rescue groups and other shelters. As such, we are able to save many more lives even though we do not limit our intake. Generally, we have found that the no-kill shelters in our area are only able to call themselves such because they limit their intake to adoptable animals only which results in flooding their municipal shelters with less adoptable candidates or denial of services for the community.   Besides creative adoption programs, fostering, marketing available animals in ads and social media, transfers, and comprehensive evaluations, we now offer to notify people who surrender or find an animal to reclaim the animal if that animal somehow becomes a candidate for euthanasia. We find this cultivates a community that better understands euthanasia decisions and can actively participate in the decision making process.

It was then that she decided to find a way to care for those animals on the streets of Baltimore, showing them that this city also has a sweet side. Her focus is mainly on getting kittens out of feral colonies, off the streets, or out of bad situations. She then works to socialize them, adopting them out when they’re ready, no matter how long it takes.

We continue that mission today by providing programs and services that annually impact thousands of people and pets in our community.   Our Programs and Services Make a Difference, One by One  * Animal care. While animals wait for their forever homes, we provide shelter, food, and a nurturing environment. Animals are examined by trained medical staff and area veterinarians who visit the shelter weekly on a rotating basis.  * Adoptions. We are a NO-KILL facility that strives to find a home for every adoptable animal.  * Humane Education. Through classroom visits, youth group programs, and civic group presentations, we bring the message of compassion, kindness and safety to hundreds of children and adults yearly.  * Lost and Found Services. Stray animals are brought to the shelter almost daily. We make efforts to reunite them with their owners by maintaining a lost/found directory and tracking callers who have either lost or found an animal. If the animal’s owner is not located after 7 business days, we try to find the animal a loving home.  * Anti-Cruelty Services. Cruelty and neglect of animals are both inhumane and illegal. Through education programs and referrals, we strive to educate the public about the laws governing animal care and cruelty. We work hand in hand with many area law enforcement agencies and other animal welfare organizations to ensure investigations of all cruelty and neglect reports and enforcement of all laws.  * Spay and Neuter Initiatives. Aggressive spay and neuter programs are essential to reducing the homeless animal population in our community. We work with other organizations to refer qualified persons to low-cost spay/neuter programs.  * Hope for the Helpless. Many of the animals coming through our doors are in desperate need of medical attention for illness or injury.

Most of our animals though are pulled from high kill shelters where they were ready to be killed either by euthanasia, gas chamber or the barbaric method of heart stick. Since we do not know what kind of life these animals experienced before or during their shelter stay many of them were more than likely exposed to illnesses which do not show up for at least 3-6 weeks later.

Puppies will not be adopted out until they have had their first two sets of vaccines and all of our cats are feline leukemia tested before they go up for adoption.

1679,18817,East Smithfield,"Animal Care Sanctuary was founded as a non-profit organization by Lesley Sinclair in 1967 in Tom’s River, NJ. After outgrowing her operation in a converted chicken farm there, Sinclair moved to rural East Smithfield, PA in 1982. Ms. Sinclair passed away in 1998, leaving a legacy to care for the animals at the organization which she founded. 2012 marks our 45th anniversary as a non-profit no kill animal sanctuary and we are eager to continue the work that we do with and for homeless animals everywhere but most importantly, the animals who have found ACS as their temporary or forever home. As the nation’s fourth largest no-kill sanctuary, ACS welcomes animals that are in particular need, those that others deem “unadoptable” because of illness, injury, age, or because they just have not been able to find a home. At this time, we have more than 700 residents at our East Smithfield and Wellsboro locations including dogs, cats, horses, pigs, and birds. We work with these animals to find them permanent homes, but we offer lifetime care if this is not possible. We also offer animal care workshops, dog training courses including a masters course, grooming, and a low cost spay/neuter clinic available to the public five days a week. In the fall of 2009, ACS partnered with Maddie’s Fund Shelter Medicine Program at Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine. The college’s Veterinary staff tours ACS facilities on an annual basis and offers recommendations for improving the animals’ medical and behavioral programs. ACS also transports sick and/or injured animals to Cornell for specialized treatments and surgeries by their shelter medicine team. In 2011, the Pennsylvania SPCA elected to discontinue their shelter services in Wellsboro, PA. In September of that year, ACS stepped in and took over the day to day operations which have proven very successful thus far. Having two locations in the state of Pennsylvania has helped us save hundreds more lives in the past seven months, as we continue to spay/neuter, vaccinate, educate, adopt, and provide a loving atmosphere for the animals who call ACS home.

We never ""don't have space"" we never ""don't have time or resources"". Somehow, some way we always ""figure it out"".   We DO euthanize animals. We do NOT euthanize animals on a time limit. There is no such thing as ""Buffy has 48 hours to get out or the shelter will put her to death"". When we are forced to euthanize animals EACH animal is given the respect of having a committee of people (one from each department in the shelter) who make a unanimous decision on what to do next. The decision MUST be unanimous and MUST include a plan for the animal with the goal of making each day better than the last.   We DO have an extensive network of volunteers (at last count we had 516 volunteers to help with hands on care of cats, dogs and small companion animals as well as behind the scenes other help.)  We DO have an extensive network of fosters, including a program that we call ""Finder Foster"" which involves having someone who finds an animal that if we know at the point of intake is too ill to be able to make it on the adoption floor, we'll intake it into our system, provide the finder with medication and schedule a return intake date for a recheck so the animal has a fair chance of getting adopted *as opposed to* being simply discarded at the initial intake. We've been able to save hundreds more animals each year since we started asking people to do this. Not everyone obliges but many people step up simply because we ask them to.  We DO have a low cost clinic that not only serves the shelter population but also the community at large. The clinic ONLY sees clients that have pets who are spayed or neutered (or are having the initial appointment for the spay/neuter surgery) and for many of the people in our low income neighborhood, if we weren't there, their pets would receive NO medical care at all.

Faced with that decision, Grace went to look for a new home, one where she would not have to make a choice to give up her pet. She found a place, now affectionately nicknamed the “farm.” After she settled into her new home, the strays started showing up – a dog here, a cat there. She would feed them and let them stay. She felt strongly that they should never be homeless again. She eventually moved to adopting out some of them if she knew a good home looking for a new companion. That’s how it started!

Through its adoption locations, special events, and foster care network, PAWS finds loving homes for thousands of animals each year.

We do so through comprehensive rescue and prevention efforts: pulling at-risk animals out of the city’s shelter and placing them in loving adoptive and foster homes, and providing low- or no-cost veterinary services and spay/neuter surgery to disadvantaged pet owners, enabling pets to remain as cherished family members rather than face abandonment and preventing the birth of unwanted litters.

There was only a group of caring people, who rescued strays, keeping them in their homes until these pitiful dogs and cats were found loving homes. In 1960, this dedicated group decided it was impractical and impossible to keep all the animals in their homes, and Strayhaven Animal Shelter was built and Incorporated.  A retired gentleman by the name of Perry Dehart, donated the land and his time to build the shelter. With help from concerned citizens and some government loans, the shelter was completed. From the beginning, the shelter was, and still is, privately run. It is the only for stray dogs and cats, to shelter, inoculate, de-worm, and find good homes. Strayhaven is unique in that it keeps its strays longer than most shelters.  At one time, board member Mary Jane Zahniser undertook payment to spay and neuter all dogs and cats. After her death in 1983, the responsibility had to go to the new owners because the shelter could not meet the expense. However, we are glad to announce that starting in 1996, the shelter is proud of the ""ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION"" low cost spay and neutering of all dogs and cats. Participating veterinarians offer a discount to each dog and cat that has been adopted from the shelter, to be spayed or neutered.

1809,29412,Charleston,"1430 Folly Road  Charleston, SC  Pet Helpers was founded in 1976 by President Carol Linville after she read that 8,000 pets were being euthanized each year at the local shelter. It began as a weekly ""adopt a pet"" column. Thirty years later, that column has grown into Pet Helpers Rescue and Adoption Shelter, one of the foremost pet rescue organizations in South Carolina. Pet Helpers has slowly evolved into a widely recognized, innovative shelter that offers caring solutions to the serious problems created by pet overpopulation.   For 30 years, we have focused on the needs of homeless animals. Through a commitment to no-kill sheltering, required spay and neuter, adoption, and 24-hour a day rescue programs, we have worked tirelessly to save those animals who are without human guardianship. We service the tri-county areas of Berkeley, Dorchester and Charleston Counties, and we are the only independent, no-kill adoption shelter that is staffed and maintains regular business hours.

ARFhouse is a Texas non-profit corporation, and received the 501(c)3 determination letter from the IRS in 1992.   Being in a rural area has advantages; the dogs have plenty of space; even those in yards, since the yards are big. Many of them get to swim in the pond. Also, we never get complaints about barking. The downside has been that it took several years for people to learn about our facility and begin to contact us to adopt a dog. Adopters frequently drive the 70 miles from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area when they see a dog on PetFinder they want. As we've become more visible, many contributors now come to us for a dog. With the support of our affiliate group, ARFhouse Chicago, we place more than 100 dogs annually through their adoption program in addition to dogs who are adopted from the Sherman, Texas location. When one dog is adopted, there is always one waiting to take his/her place here at ARFhouse.   Address: 3377 Spalding Rd.

We never euthanize an animal to make room for another, and we care for all those we take in until they are adopted.  We try to place these animals in new homes with caring families as soon as possible. Some stay at Fuzzy Friends Rescue only a matter of days or weeks, but sometimes it takes months of care and rehabilitation before they are able to go to a new home. In some cases for those harder- to- place animals, their stay may be a year or more. Unless they have developed an incurable disease or they are aggressive they have a home at Fuzzy Friends Rescue until they can be found a permanent, loving home.

1919,78415,Corpus Christi,"On January 15, 1945, a group of animal lovers led by Frances Weil filed a charter to form the Gulf Coast Humane Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. On March 22, 1947, the Society filed a charter amendment changing the name to Gulf Coast Humane Society, its corporate name until 1976, when it was amended to PAWS-Gulf Coast Humane Society.  From its beginning, the men and women of the Society acted as humane officers for Nueces and the surrounding counties. In Corpus Christi, the Society members worked closely with the police officers assigned to humane duties and the City Pound. In 1947, the Society acquired a permanent home. They purchased 3.2 acres of land on Navigation Boulevard. It was through annual fund drives, rummage sales, charity balls, and similar efforts that the Society was able to pay off the land purchases and build a very fine kennel building.  In 1997, the board of directors decided to revert back to the previous name of Gulf Coast Humane Society. In April 1998, the Society began operating from a new facility. The facility was made possible by the generous donation of Tom and Cora Keeler. The new facility is double the size of the Society's old home, allowing the organization to help more animals and offer expanded education and services to the public.",Gulf Coast Humane Society,Texas,http://www.gchscc.org,TX

We serve more animals per resident than nearly any other shelter in the state and offer programs and services to meet a wide array of critical animal welfare needs. ACHS provides these services without any county, state or federal funding.   ACHS is a No-Kill Shelter and is strongly committed to providing the highest quality of care to all animals that enter our shelter. At the shelter, we house approximately fourteen (14) dogs, one hundred and twenty-five (125) cats, and approximately ten (10) other small animals such as rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, and birds. We also provide services to an unlimited number of animals (dogs, cats, horses, cows, goats, pigs and other farm animals) through our foster care program. Through the use of a group of dedicated foster families, we are able to place animals in their homes, thus providing service throughout the county for many animals. Foster care services are most often provided for animals in emergency situations such as special needs animals, pregnant cats, and animals rescued through our Cruelty Response Program.   As a No-Kill Shelter, ACHS strongly believes that every animal who enters our shelter deserves to be cared for in a nurturing and loving environment by compassionate employees and volunteers, is entitled to the best medical care that we can provide to them and must be given every opportunity to find a loving and permanent home. We never euthanize animals due to space or capacity constraints and will only euthanize an animal if he/she is suffering from a chronic and painful medical condition or is extremely aggressive and cannot be safely adopted out to the community.

Founder Jan Gordon Stangel used her own funds to finance the service and found homes for nearly 150 companion animals in her first three years. With growing recognition of the thousands of animals needing help, Jan and the volunteers involved in her adoption service sought 501(C3) nonprofit status in 1994 and with this, Lamoille County Humane Society (LCHS) was born.  During its first three years in operation, LCHS adopted close to 400 animals per year. In 1996, the board voted to change the name to North Country Animal League (NCAL). This name more accurately embodies the inclusive philosophy of everyone involved with our mission. With great support from the community, NCAL has adopted over 6,000 animals since 1994. Through the geneosity of local veterinarians, and support from volunteers and adopters, every adopted animal has been spayed or neutered.  In 1999, NCAL became a ""limited-access"" facility, meaning NCAL no longer euthanizes animals in our care to make room for incoming animals. When our shelter is full, we maintain a waiting list. Since we conduct an average of 2 adoptions/day, kennel space opens weekly. NCAL will only euthanize animals due to terminal illness or for aggression that cannot be modified through behavioral training.

FOHA is the only no-kill shelter of its size in the area, where visitors can meet many animals until they find the perfect pet for them. Our animals are all spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, and tested (and if necessary treated) for heartworm and other medical conditions.

2104,98223,Arlington,"230 McRae Road NE Arlington, WA 98223  Purrfect Pals was born from the tireless dedication of woman who has committed her life to cats: Kathy Centala. Kathy founded Purrfect Pals in 1988, originally as a boarding facility for cats which also helped the occassional homeless cat. Quickly Kathy found herself taking in more and more orphaned cats, overwhelming her small Brier, Washington home.  In the early 1990s Kathy moved Purrfect Pals to a spacious 5 acre spread in rural Arlington, Washington. By converting her new home into a shelter, Kathy was able to provide a comfortable sanctuary to hundreds of cats. And best of all for Kathy, she gets to sleep with 25 cats every night!  Because of our rural location, Purrfect Pals has pioneered off-site adoption events and placement of cats in partner pet stores. In the early years we placed just a few dozen cats every year, but now we've grown to the point where we place more than 2,000 cats every year through our shelter and more than 20 off-site locations across Puget Sound.  The Purrfect Pals sanctuaries have become one of the most important cat resources in all of North America. Our comfortable sanctuary spaces for Feral Cats, cats with Leukemia, cats with FIV, and cats with behavioral issues set a standard for cat comfort and care.  In the late 1990s we opened the Purrfect Pals Cat Hospital on our campus to provide top-quality care for our shelter cats and also to provide free and low-cost spay and neuter surgeries to low-income families. Annually our veterinarians perform more than 2,000 surgeries.  Purrfect Pals has become well-known for our two signature events: the Black Cat Ball and the Average Joe Cat Show. The Black Cat Ball is held the final sunday in October. A gala auction and gourmet dinner, the Black Cat Ball raises money for the shelter. The Average Joe Cat Show is a fun cat show for family cats. The Average Joe Cat Show is held every year in Spring.  In early 2006 Purrfect Pals opened FIV-Land, an innovative cat adoption facilty for cats with FIV. Purrfect Pals is currently adopting about 60 FIV cats a year, 10 times more than any other shelter in the world.",Purrfect Pals,Washington,http://www.purrfectpals.org/,WA

When a new rescue would come into our homes, we would talk about the terrible things people do to animals and say that we should do something more about the situation. But there were always litter boxes to scoop, animals to care for, and day jobs to go do - and there were animal welfare organizations already in existence that would surely take care of the matter. So...we always put the matter on the back burner; and in the meantime, we would continue to take more and more rescued animals into our homes. All of us were running out of room.

In 1992, after I was diagnosed with Lupus and RA (autoimmune diseases, which would be one reason I could not have children), I moved back by my family in Abbotsford, Wisconsin. I saved a few more cats, but in 1994, I had a chance to purchase my first home in the City of Abbotsford (pop. 2,000?). Now that I had my own place, I knew it would be easier to help the animals. It’s amazing how many people from different towns knew me and called me to come and help an animal. From 1998 to 2001, I volunteered at a shelter in a neighboring town, until they had to close down due to a lack of funds. I did take home a couple of cats from the shelter and tried to save many newborn kittens. It is rare to have a good outcome with newborn kittens. The ones that did not make it are laid to rest in our front yard. I am there for each one of my animals that have to be euthanized (or are dying naturally), and I hold them as they die, always telling them how much their Mom and Dad love them and will always love them. I do lose control when they are gone and cry for days. I always say a prayer for them. We hold every single animal, unless it is a case where an animal dies while we are sleeping or not home. I even lost my 20-year old cat, Twique, on 9/11/08, of all days. We have so much heartbreak with doing this and so many pleasures.   510 North Third Avenue  Abbotsford, Wisconsin 54405   Call us: (715) 316-0054",th Life Rescue and Sanctuairy,Wisconsin,http://9thlifebeta.weebly.com/,WI

We have adopted cats out after having them at the shelter for years, and just last month adopted out April, a 12 year old cat, after 13 months with us.

During her undergraduate schooling she spent her spare time working with a local shelter providing foster care for orphaned newborn kittens and puppies.

Our goal is to give current owners and/or concerned citizens another option to help combat the euthanasia statistics currently in Milwaukee.  Most of our animals come to us directly from prior owners that for whatever reason cannot care for their cat(s) any longer. The number one reason for animals being surrendered is because owners are moving and cannot - or will not - take their cats along. Other reasons for cats being surrendered are owners death, divorce, or people become bored with - or tired of - their current pet. Some of our animals are also found as strays. Whatever the reason may be, we believe these cats deserve a second chance at a permanent and loving life-time home.
